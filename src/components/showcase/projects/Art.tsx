                    While I love programming and software development, Art,
                    Design, and Animation will always hold a special place in my

                    Here are a few projects/things I've done over the years to
                    keep the artistic side of me alive. I'm always looking to
                    push myself creatively and learn new things.

                    In high school, I started learning how to draw and animate
                    pixel art after becoming interested in video game
                    development. As I worked on making games over the years, I
                    learned so much about pixel art and fell in love with
                    animation.

                    This page is currently a work in progress. I've recently
                    found myself wanting to make more pixel art recently and I
                    have some project plans and ideas in the works. Expect
                    updates to this page as I dive back into the world of pixel
                    art!
