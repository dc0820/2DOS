                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things such as computers. In
                    elementary school.

                    In 2020, I got accepted into The University of Texas at 
                    San Antonio to study Cyber Security. It was my first choice
                    and I was absolutely ecstatic to be going to such a great
                    university.

                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/music">Music Production</Link>{' '}
                            and creating{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/art">Digital Art</Link>. You can
                            read more about each of these on their respective
                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                        <p>
                            In college, I was an active member of the National Honor Society of Leadership and 
                            Success as well as a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society in
                            the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
